              <p>Got a pesto danish, smoked salmon croissant sandwich, and one of the plum tarts. Everything was so tasty and the pastry was buttery and flakey. The tart had a custard layer that was smooth and creamy - would definitely recommend this little bakery!</p>

              <p>Visited Belle Vie Cafe & Bakery on Labour Day when many shops were closed so they were incredibly busy. Despite how busy they were I found the staff extremely hardworking and provided us a lovely visit. The food was delicious and we brought some baguettes home which are top notch. Prices are also surprisingly reasonable for how nice the place is! We will be back!</p>

              <p>My absolute favourite bakery this side of Toronto. I love that they repurposed the French restaurant that once stood here and that left such a hole in the food scene and community when the owners retired. The bakery is delightful and has lovely service and food items. I’ve enjoyed breakfast and lunch items too here.</p>
